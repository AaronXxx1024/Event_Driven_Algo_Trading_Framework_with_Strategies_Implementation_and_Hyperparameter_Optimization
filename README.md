# Event_Driven_Algo_Trading_Framework_with_Strategies_Implementation_and_Hyperparameter_Optimization
Unfinished: Completed Algo Trading Framework with Strategies Implementatio and Machine Learning Interface for Hyperparameters or Hybrid Trading Strategies.

## Why I create this?
To simplifiy whole algo trading process and use it for my own research purpose. The advantage of this framework is I can focus on strategy itself (especially how to calculate signals and make strategies compatible with other data analysis methods and external machine learning libraries) instead of other 'redundant' calculation process.

## Main Design Idea.
The main design idea is based on Dr. Ernest Chan's *How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business* and Dr. Michael L.Halls-Moore's *Successful Algorithmic Trading*. 

## Here is the difference that I've done:
1. Provided more methods for calling data and statistical test. Integrated those in same framwork.
2. Updated some calculation methods and data structures to increase the running speed.
3. Created interface for external machine learning library and make it adaptable to strategies implementated in this framework.
4. Added capital allocation methods for better position optimazation. 
 
# To-do
1. More trading strategies implementation to verify the stability of the framework.
2. More methods for data cleaning used in different strategies.
3. API for all hyperpartameters that used for optimaizing each strategy.
4. API for connection between the framework and external ML library. This process should be compatitle to step 2.
5. Re-do my old Fame-French factor model and make it suitable to current framework.
